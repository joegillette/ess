				<h2 class="header-fonts">How does it work?</h2>
				<p>Considering you've received a copy of the ESS client it goes to say that you know what's going on pay-wise but now you're probably wondering what the software itself does. The way that this system works is by going off of base prices found on the grand exchange (listed by customer of course) and takes 55% off of that base price (making it desirable initially for buyers). "How do I make profit then?" you might wonder but that's quite simple... procurement charge and deliver charge.</p>
				<p>What that means is that you will be compensated for gathering the item based off of the price given for that item. The exact way of placing how much you will make is by using the software and following the instructions above to find how much you will make. If you're really interested in finding out how much you will be making then follow the process below.</p>

				<h2 class="header-fonts">Doing some math!</h2>
				<p>The method used is simple. Take the base amount of GP for the item(s) and multiply that by the amount of items requested. Once you've done that remove 55% of that amount in order to find the base amount. Then take the base amount and add 46% of the base price to the base price.</p>
				<p>Remember that the software itself does this calculation for you, leaving you to take that 46% share of said items.</p>
