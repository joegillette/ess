				<h2 class="header-fonts">How does it work?</h2>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">The system works by taking the ge price, getting a 10% discount, and then adding 25% to the discounted price. This is calculation is also displayed per item on the calculated price window.</p>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">For a clear example say you had a piece of iron ore worth 100gp and you didn't want to smelt it, instead giving it to someone who would charge you to smelt if for you while you would make up the lost money elsewhere. That 100gp ore would cost 90gp after discount, and then 112.5gp (113 because rounding) after 25% of that 90% was added.</p>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">Note that this an example used only to show you the percentages and not an actual representation of any prices.</p>

				<h2 class="header-fonts">Coming Soon!!</h2>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">This is all that's here for now, though I'm hoping that at some point in the future, through user input for math tweaking and recommendations, that ESS will be a viable and logical option for anyone seeking a great way to make money.</p>
