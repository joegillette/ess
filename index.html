				<h2 class="header-fonts">How does it work?</h2>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">The way that this system works is by going off of base prices found on the grand exchange (listed by customer of course) and takes 55% off of that base price (making it desirable initially for buyers).<br> "How do I make profit then?" you might wonder but that's quite simple... procurement charge and delivery charge.</p>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">What that means is that you will be compensated for gathering the item based off of the price given for that item.<br> The exact way of placing how much you will make is by using the software and following the instructions above to find how much you will make.<br> If you're really interested in finding out how much you will be making then follow the process below.</p>

			<div class="info-window">
				<h2 class="header-fonts">Doing some math!</h2>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">The method used is simple. Take the base amount of GP for the item(s) and multiply that by the amount of items requested.<br> Once you've done that remove 55% of that amount in order to find the base amount. Then take the base amount and add 46% of the base price to the base price.</p>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">Remember that the software itself does this calculation for you, leaving you to take that 46% share of said items.</p>

				<h2 class="header-fonts">Coming Soon!!</h2>
				<p class="alignment-fixer">This is all that's here for now, though I'm hoping that at some point in the future, through user input for math tweaking and recommendations, that ESS will be a viable and logical option for anyone seeking a great way to make money.</p>
